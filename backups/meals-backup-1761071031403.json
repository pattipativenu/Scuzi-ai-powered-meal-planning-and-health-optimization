A small amount of dried fruit provides quick carbs to replenish glycogen without overloading on sugar. Together, this mix delivers sustained energy and a wealth of micronutrients like zinc, magnesium, and B-vitamins. It’s an excellent grab-and-go snack for before or after a workout, or during a long day when you need a concentrated source of fuel that also supports heart and gut health (nuts and seeds fiber feed good gut bacteria).",

Cinnamon helps with blood sugar control and adds flavor. This is a great post-workout shake to speed recovery – you get fast-absorbing protein for muscle repair, plus compounds that lower inflammation and oxidative stress. And unlike many store-bought shakes, it has no artificial additives and includes whole-food ingredients that support your gut (spices can promote beneficial gut bacteria).",
