The dark chocolate (70%+) adds antioxidants (flavanols) that improve blood flow and reduce exercise-induced stress, plus it satisfies sweet cravings in a healthier way. A small amount of dried fruit provides quick carbs to replenish glycogen without overloading on sugar. Together, this mix delivers sustained energy and a wealth of micronutrients like zinc, magnesium, and B-vitamins. It’s an excellent grab-and-go snack for before or after a workout, or during a long day when you need a concentrated source of fuel that also supports heart and gut health (nuts and seeds fiber feed good gut bacteria).","[""Recovery"",""Energy"",""Better Performance""]"

Cinnamon helps with blood sugar control and adds flavor. This is a great post-workout shake to speed recovery – you get fast-absorbing protein for muscle repair, plus compounds that lower inflammation and oxidative stress.
